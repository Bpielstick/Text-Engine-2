# AGENTS.md

## Project Type
This is a browser-based JavaScript project intended for Itch.io. It runs entirely in the browser using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No Node.js runtime, package manager, or external build tools are used.

## Restrictions
- Do NOT use or attempt to run `npm`, `npx`, or `mocha`.
- Do NOT add or modify `package.json`, `node_modules`, or any Node-based test framework.
- Do NOT assume the presence of Node.js, internet access, or any server-side execution environment.
- Do NOT generate test files that rely on Mocha, Jest, or any Node.js testing libraries.

## Requirements
- All output must be plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can run directly in a browser.
- Code must be standalone and compatible with static hosting platforms like Itch.io.
- Testing (if needed) should be done using simple in-browser `console.log` or custom functions.
- Do not use ES module imports unless the module is included locally.

## Deployment
- The final game should consist of one or more `.html`, `.js`, and `.css` files placed in a single directory, suitable for upload to Itch.io as an HTML5 game.
